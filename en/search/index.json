[{"content":" The bass player builds the house that all the other players get to live in.\n\u0026ndash; Abe Laboriel Sr.\nAs a bassist, I love adding depth, movement, and emotion to songs. Gospel music has particularly shaped me – it’s where I learned to play with groove, dynamics, and expression, and to explore the full range of intensity. I bring this musical approach to every context – whether it’s pop, rock, funk, or soul.\nI work live and in the studio with a diverse range of artists, finding the perfect bass sound for each song: from earthy and understated to present and powerful. My goal is always the same: to support the song and bring it to life.\nSome of the live and studio productions I played on Krís Madarász, Christian Renz\nWie soll ich dich empfangen (Du kommst zu uns) Martin Pepper\nFlügelleicht 25 Lukas-KIDS\nJesus, du bist Sieger Martin Pepper\nLebenshaus Martin Pepper\nAlles in Liebe Rudi Hampel\nLieder für euch Martin Pepper\nFunkenflug Gospel im Osten\nWindow of Hope Karsten Schneider\nPsalmpoet Christian Renz\nSongs for Shanghai Panta Rei\nOlo s\u0026#39;echo sto myalo mou Diversity Praiz\nPower On The Gospel House\nLooking For You Chorios\nMenschen 2B1\nHadirmu ","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://renzwertig.de/de/service/bass/cover_hu_69064b5d44023816.jpg","permalink":"https://renzwertig.de/en/service/bass/","title":"Bass – Live and in the Studio"},{"content":"Whether it\u0026rsquo;s a catchy pop song, a powerful rock track, a touching singer-songwriter piece, or a vibrant gospel anthem – as a producer, my job is to bring your musical vision to life.
