My label <b>renzwertig</b> provides artists with the freedom to focus entirely on their music – I take care of the administrative tasks in the background. This includes registering recordings with GEMA and GVL, assigning ISRC codes for accurate tracking of works, and coordinating with the pressing plant for physical releases. I also ensure professional publication of music on all relevant streaming platforms. Additionally, I can register songs suitable for use in Christian communities with [CCLI](https://ccli.com).
