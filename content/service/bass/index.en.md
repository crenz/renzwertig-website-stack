As a bassist, I love adding depth, movement, and emotion to songs. Gospel music has particularly shaped me – it’s where I learned to play with groove, dynamics, and expression, and to explore the full range of intensity. I bring this musical approach to every context – whether it’s pop, rock, funk, or soul.

I work live and in the studio with a diverse range of artists, finding the perfect bass sound for each song: from earthy and understated to present and powerful. My goal is always the same: to support the song and bring it to life.
