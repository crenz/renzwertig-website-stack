*Verse 1*\
There will come a day\
Every tear is wiped away\
There will come a day\
Where depression turns into joy\
Every sickness will find healing\
And fear will give way to hope\
There will come a day\
There will come a day

*Verse 2*\
There will come a day\
Every slave will be set free\
There will come a day\
Where there‘s no more poverty\
Where victims will be kings and rulers\
And debt will be dethroned\
There will come a day\
There will come a day

*Chorus*\
This is our hope\
This is our faith\
That Christ will make all things new\
And after death comes life\
This is our hope\
This is our faith\
The whole creation will be put to rights\
He will make that day

*Verse 3*\
And on that very day\
When we finish our race\
On that very day\
We will see him face to face\
God will make his home amongst us\
And his children will be revealed\
We will see that day\
We will see that day

*Ending*\
Every prayer every word every deed\
And every song we wrote\
Will find their place in the kingdom of our God\
Our art and our poetry fellowship and community\
Our labour here will not be in vain\
We will see that day
